A big part of our users hold several key rights. These include:

Right to access: You have the right to obtain confirmation that your personal data are processed and to obtain a copy of it as well as certain information related to their processing;
Right to rectify: You can request the rectification of your personal data which are inaccurate, and also add to them. You can also change your personal data in your account at any time.
Right to delete: You can, in some cases, have your personal data deleted;
Right to object: You can object, for reasons relating to your situation, to the processing of your personal data For instance, you have the right to object where we rely on legitimate interest or where we process your data for direct marketing purposes;
 Right to restrict processing: You have the right, in certain cases, to temporarily restrict the processing of your personal data by us, provided there are valid grounds for doing so. We may continue to process your personal data if it is necessary for the defense against legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law;
Right to contest to a decision based solely on automated processing: You have the right to require that decisions be reconsidered if they are made solely by automated means, without human involvement. We use automated tools to make sure that you are eligible to be our customer taking into account our interests and legal obligations; if these automated tools indicate that you do not meet our acceptance criteria, we will not onboard you as our customer;
Right to portability: In some cases, you can ask to receive your personal data which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or, when this is possible, to have us communicate your personal data on your behalf directly to another data controller;
Right to withdraw your consent: for processing requiring your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Exercising this right does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent given before the withdrawal of the latter;
Right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority: We hope that we can resolve any queries you may have about the way in which we process your personal data. However, if you have unresolved concerns, you also have the right to complain to the data protection authority in the location in which you live, work or believe a data protection breach has occurred.

Please note that while these rights represent our global standard, the actual rights available to you may vary depending on your jurisdiction. We encourage you to check the specific set of rights on the applicable Privacy Notice for your jurisdiction by clicking here and selecting your country of residence on the top right of our website.

That said, we are happy to accommodate any user request for the deletion of any of your personal data that is not explicitly required to be kept under applicable laws.

During the onboarding process at Binance, we do employ automated decision-making. It is widely used in our Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures. When you send us your documents, along with a photo and a live video, we use automation to accurately verify your identity, ensuring we comply with Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) regulations globally.
However, we're aware that this process isn't perfect, and sometimes errors can occur. A classic example is when twin siblings attempt to set up separate accounts. Our system might mistakenly interpret this as one person trying to open two accounts under different names. There are other unique scenarios that might also lead to inaccuracies.
Because we understand that these situations can arise, we've made sure to equip our app with relevant support features. If you need assistance, simply follow these steps in the app or webpage:

Open the app/webpage and sign in to your account.
Navigate to your profile and select the headphone/chat icon.
Click on "View more" on the Self-Service section and Scroll down to the KYC section.
Select the option that best suits your need, like "Failed Facial Verification Appeal", or "Appeal KYC Rejection."

If you follow these steps, we'll forward your request to one of our dedicated KYC Customer Support Agents. They'll take a closer look at your case with a manual review to ensure everything's in order. After a thorough check, they'll get back to you with an updated response. 
If you still need our help, please contact us through our customer support or our DPO team via email09How do I exercise my right to data portability?In some cases, you can ask to receive your personal data which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or, when this is possible, that we communicate your personal data on your behalf directly to another data controller.
You can obtain a copy of your personal data with us to share with another data controller using our  Privacy Center,  located on the “settings” tab of your account.10How do I withdraw my consent?We may rely upon your consent to use personal data to perform some processing activities.
